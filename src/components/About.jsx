            I am a passionate MERN stack web developer at the junior level,
            currently pursuing my honors fourth year. With a strong foundation
            in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, I have successfully
            completed 20+ projects, building dynamic and scalable web
            applications. I thrive on problem-solving, clean code, and
            user-friendly designs. Always eager to learn and grow, I stay
            updated with the latest web development trends and best practices.
